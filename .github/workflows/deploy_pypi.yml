# PyPI Publishing Workflow - Modern Best Practices (2025)
# Uses: Trusted Publisher (OIDC) + uv for secure, fast publishing
#
# Setup Required (One-time):
# 1. PyPI Trusted Publisher: https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
#    - Add publisher for: JFK/kagura-ai, workflow: deploy_pypi.yml, environment: pypi
# 2. TestPyPI (optional): Same setup at https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
#
# Usage:
#   - Tag: git tag v4.0.12 && git push origin v4.0.12
#   - GitHub Release: Create release from tag (triggers publish)
#   - Prerelease: Check "This is a pre-release" → publishes to TestPyPI
#   - Full Release: Leave unchecked → publishes to PyPI
