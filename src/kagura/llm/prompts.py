# Session Summary: {session_id}

## Overview
Implemented authentication middleware for FastAPI, including JWT token validation and role-based access control.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. JWT vs Session-based Auth
- **Decision:** Use JWT tokens with RS256 signing
- **Rationale:** Stateless auth enables horizontal scaling, RS256 provides better security than HS256
- **Impact:** No session storage needed, but requires key rotation strategy

### 2. Access Control Pattern
- **Decision:** Decorator-based permission checks
- **Rationale:** Clean separation of concerns, reusable across endpoints
- **Impact:** Reduces boilerplate, easier to audit permissions

## Challenges & Solutions

### TypeError in token validation
- **Challenge:** Token expiry comparison failing with TypeError
- **Root Cause:** datetime comparison between aware/naive datetime objects
- **Solution:** Ensure all timestamps use UTC timezone
- **Prevention:** Add type hints and use datetime.utcnow() consistently

## Patterns Observed

**Good Practices:**
- Comprehensive type hints throughout
- Extensive unit tests for edge cases
- Clear docstrings with examples

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Some functions exceed 50 lines (consider refactoring)
- Magic strings for role names (use Enum instead)

**Coding Style:**
- Prefers functional approach over OOP
- Follows Pydantic validation patterns
- Uses async/await consistently

## Recommendations

1. **Extract role definitions to Enum** - Replace string literals with `UserRole` enum for type safety
2. **Add integration tests** - Current tests are unit-only, add E2E auth flow tests
3. **Implement token refresh** - Current JWT has no refresh mechanism
4. **Document security assumptions** - Add security.md explaining threat model
5. **Set up pre-commit hooks** - Ensure type checking runs before commits

### Pattern Structure
```yaml
name: Brief descriptive name (e.g., "Off-by-one in loop indices")

  Step-by-step, copy-pastable when possible.

examples:

- Confidence < 0.7 for weak patterns, > 0.8 for strong patterns
- Be specific: "Missing null checks on API responses" not "TypeError"
- Include code examples in prevention strategies

## Example Output
```yaml
patterns:
  - name: "Async/await inconsistency in database calls"
    frequency: 5
    confidence: 0.9
    severity: medium

    root_cause: |
      Mixing sync and async database calls due to unclear API.
      The ORM provides both `query()` (sync) and `aquery()` (async),
      but the async requirement isn't enforced by type system.

    prevention_strategy: |
      1. Use async-only database client (e.g., asyncpg instead of psycopg2)
      2. Add type hints: `async def func() -> Awaitable[Result]`
      3. Enable pyright strict mode to catch missing awaits
      4. Code review checklist: "All DB calls use await?"

      Example pattern to follow:
      ```python
      async def get_user(user_id: int) -> User:
          result = await db.aquery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1", user_id)
          return User.parse_obj(result)
      ```

    quick_fix: |
      1. Identify the sync call (usually missing `await`)
      2. Add `await` keyword: `result = await db.query(...)`
      3. Ensure function is marked `async def`
      4. Check all callers also use `await` on this function

    examples:
      - "api/users.py:45 - RuntimeError: no running event loop"
      - "api/posts.py:33 - coroutine was never awaited"
      - "services/auth.py:78 - Task was destroyed but it is pending"

  - name: "Type mismatches in JSON API responses"
    frequency: 4
    confidence: 0.85
    severity: medium

    root_cause: |
      External API returns numeric IDs as strings ("123" vs 123),
      but our Pydantic models expect integers. The API is inconsistent
      (sometimes string, sometimes int) depending on the endpoint.

    prevention_strategy: |
      1. Use Pydantic validators to coerce types:
      ```python
      class User(BaseModel):
          id: int

          @validator('id', pre=True)
          def coerce_id(cls, v):
              return int(v) if isinstance(v, str) else v
      ```
      2. Add integration tests that use real API responses (recorded)
      3. Document API inconsistencies in api_docs.md
      4. Consider using `str | int` union type if coercion is risky

    quick_fix: |
      1. Locate the Pydantic model causing ValidationError
      2. Add pre-validator to coerce the field type
      3. Test with both string and int inputs
      4. Update API documentation to note inconsistency

    examples:
      - "models/user.py:15 - ValidationError: id value is not a valid integer"
      - "models/post.py:23 - ValidationError: author_id must be integer"
```

## Example Output
```yaml
confidence: high

primary_solution:
  steps: |
    1. The error occurs because you're comparing a timezone-aware datetime
       with a naive datetime object. This is a common issue with JWT expiry checks.

    2. Ensure all datetime objects use UTC timezone:
       ```python
       # BEFORE (causes TypeError)
       if token.exp < datetime.now():
           raise TokenExpired()

       # AFTER (correct)
       if token.exp < datetime.now(timezone.utc):
           raise TokenExpired()
       ```

    3. Update the token generation to also use UTC:
       ```python
       exp = datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(hours=24)
       ```

    4. Add type hint to enforce timezone-aware datetimes:
       ```python
       from datetime import datetime, timezone

       def validate_token(token: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
           exp: datetime = decode_jwt(token)["exp"]
           # Ensure exp is timezone-aware
           if exp.tzinfo is None:
               exp = exp.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)
           if exp < datetime.now(timezone.utc):
               raise TokenExpired()
       ```

  reasoning: |
    This error matches the pattern from errors #42 and #87 (both datetime
    comparison issues). The root cause is mixing naive and aware datetimes,
    which Python 3.11+ explicitly forbids.

    The solution works because:
    1. All times are in UTC (no daylight saving issues)
    2. Comparisons are between same types (both aware)
    3. Type hints catch future mistakes at development time

    Past resolution in error #87 used the same approach and successfully
    prevented recurrence for 3 months.

  code_example: |
    ```python
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
    from typing import Any

    def create_token(user_id: int, expires_in: timedelta) -> str:
        '''Create JWT with timezone-aware expiry.'''
        exp = datetime.now(timezone.utc) + expires_in
        payload = {"sub": user_id, "exp": exp}
        return encode_jwt(payload)

    def validate_token(token: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
        '''Validate JWT expiry with timezone-aware comparison.'''
        try:
            payload = decode_jwt(token)
            exp_timestamp = payload["exp"]

            # JWT exp is Unix timestamp - convert to aware datetime
            exp = datetime.fromtimestamp(exp_timestamp, tz=timezone.utc)

            if exp < datetime.now(timezone.utc):
                raise TokenExpired("Token has expired")

            return payload
        except (KeyError, ValueError) as e:
            raise InvalidToken(f"Invalid token format: {e}")
    ```

alternative_solutions:
  - approach: "Store expiry as Unix timestamp"
    when_to_use: "If you want to avoid datetime complexity entirely"
    steps: |
      1. Store/compare expiry as integer Unix timestamps
      2. Use `time.time()` instead of datetime objects
      3. Example: `if token.exp < time.time(): raise TokenExpired()`

      Pros: No timezone issues, simpler
      Cons: Less readable, no datetime features

  - approach: "Use arrow or pendulum library"
    when_to_use: "If working extensively with timezones"
    steps: |
      1. `pip install arrow`
      2. Use `arrow.utcnow()` instead of datetime
      3. All arrow objects are timezone-aware by default

      Pros: Cleaner API, better timezone handling
      Cons: Additional dependency

similar_pattern: |
  This is the "naive-aware datetime comparison" pattern seen in:
  - Error #42: Token validation (3 months ago) - Resolved with UTC enforcement
  - Error #87: Database timestamp comparison (1 month ago) - Same solution

  Pattern: Mixing datetime.now() (naive) with datetime from external source (aware)
  Prevention: Always use datetime.now(timezone.utc) in new code

debugging_tips: |
  If the error persists after applying the solution:
  1. Check if datetime is coming from a database that stores naive times
     - Solution: Add `tzinfo=timezone.utc` when reading from DB
  2. Verify JWT library's decode behavior - some return naive datetimes
     - Solution: Convert explicitly: `dt.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)`
  3. Enable pyright strict mode to catch naive/aware mismatches at dev time
  4. Add assertion: `assert exp.tzinfo is not None, "Expected aware datetime"`
```

## Example Compression

**Original (437 tokens):**
```
In this session, we worked on implementing the authentication system for our API.
We spent considerable time deciding between different approaches. Initially, we
considered using session-based authentication, which is a traditional approach
that stores user state on the server. However, after discussing the pros and cons,
we ultimately decided to implement JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication instead.

The main reasons for this decision were:
1. Stateless authentication enables better horizontal scaling because we don't need
   to store sessions in a database or cache
2. JWTs can be validated without database lookups, improving performance
3. The token-based approach works better for our planned mobile app integration
4. We can easily implement role-based access control by including claims in the token

During implementation, we encountered several errors. The first error was a TypeError
when comparing datetime objects. This happened because we were comparing a timezone-aware
datetime from the JWT with a naive datetime from datetime.now(). The solution was to
use datetime.now(timezone.utc) consistently throughout the codebase. This same error
had occurred before in a different module, which suggests we should add a linting rule
to catch this pattern.

We also decided to use RS256 signing instead of HS256 because RS256 provides better
security through asymmetric keys, even though it's slightly more complex to set up.
```

**Level 1 (43 tokens - 10%):**
```
Implemented JWT auth system with RS256 signing. Resolved datetime comparison TypeError
by enforcing UTC timestamps. Pattern suggests adding linter rule for timezone handling.
```

**Level 2 (131 tokens - 30%):**
```
## Session: Auth System Implementation

**Key Decisions:**
- JWT over sessions: stateless scaling, no DB lookups, mobile-ready (#decision-1)
- RS256 over HS256: asymmetric keys for better security (#decision-2)

**Errors Resolved:**
- #error-15: TypeError in datetime comparison (auth.py:42)
  - Cause: Mixed naive/aware datetimes
  - Fix: Use datetime.now(timezone.utc) consistently
  - Note: 2nd occurrence of this pattern → add linter rule

**Impact:** Auth system functional, blocks mobile app development work

  - Stateless → horizontal scaling without session store
  - No DB lookup on validation → better performance
  - Better mobile app integration
  - Easy RBAC via token claims
- Alternative: Session-based (rejected for scaling concerns)

**#decision-2: RS256 vs HS256 Signing**
- Chose: RS256 (asymmetric keys)
- Rationale: Better security through public/private key separation
- Trade-off: More setup complexity, acceptable for security gain

### Errors

**#error-15: TypeError - Datetime Comparison**
- Location: auth.py:42, token validation
- Message: "can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes"
- Cause: JWT exp (aware) compared with datetime.now() (naive)
- Solution: Use datetime.now(timezone.utc) consistently across codebase
- Pattern: 2nd occurrence (also #error-8 in db_utils.py)
- Action Item: Add pyright rule or linter to catch naive datetime usage

### Implementation

Files: auth.py, middleware.py, models/user.py
Tests: 15 new tests, 92% coverage on auth module
Duration: 2.3 hours

### Impact

- ✅ Enables: Mobile app development (was blocked)
- ⚠️ Requires: Key rotation strategy (not yet implemented)
- 📋 Follow-up: Token refresh mechanism, revocation list
