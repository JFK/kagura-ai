## Key Features

- **YAML-based Configuration**: Define agents, workflows, and state models in a human-readable format.
- **Multiple LLM Support**: Seamlessly integrate with OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Google, and more via [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm).
- **State Management**: Type-safe state handling with Pydantic models.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Build and control complex AI workflows through multi-agent composition.
- **Extensibility**: Customize tools, hooks, and plugins to extend functionality.
- **Multilingual**: Native support for multiple languages.
- **Assistant Interface**: Console-based interactions with optional Redis-backed memory for persistence.

## Core Components

### Agent Types
- **Atomic Agent**: Fundamental, stateful LLM agents with pre/post-processing hooks.
- **Function Agent**: Task-specific, independent data processors.
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Multi-agent workflow controller built on [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph).

### State Management
- Pydantic model validation for type-safe state handling.
- Inter-agent state sharing for seamless data transfer.
- YAML-based serialization for persistence and portability.

### Tool Integration
- Custom tool and hook support for extending agent capabilities.
- Pre/post-processing hooks for flexible data handling.
- Connectors for external services to enhance workflow integration.

### Assistant Interface
- Console-based interaction with a user-friendly interface.
- Optional persistent memory using Redis.
- [WIP] Ability to call Kagura agent functions directly from the console.
