# Design Philosophy & Architecture

## Core Design Principles

Kagura AI is built on modular, state-driven architecture that prioritizes flexibility and maintainability. The framework enables developers to create sophisticated AI systems through composable components and clear state management.

## Key Concepts

### Modular Agent Design
- **Independent Components**: Each agent operates as a self-contained unit with defined roles and responsibilities.
- **State Models**: Agents maintain their own state with Pydantic-based type safety.
- **Extensible Framework**: Support for custom tools and processing hooks.
- **Collaborative Operation**: Agents can work independently or as part of larger systems.

### State-Driven Architecture
- **Type-Safe Definitions**: Pydantic models ensure data consistency.
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Seamless state sharing between components.
- **State Bindings**: Defined pathways for data flow between agents.

### Workflow Orchestration
- **Multi-Agent Composition**: Design and control complex AI systems.
- **Conditional Workflows**: Support for branching and decision-making.
- **Coordinated Execution**: Smooth integration between components.

## Implementation Structure
